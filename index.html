        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the Written Revolution! We are an MIT student group who came together to create a platform for revolutionary ideas. Our bi-monthly zine began in February 2024 to uplift the voices of the Palestinian struggle in the US war machine. We feature poetry, essays, speeches, cartoons, art, and any other content which forwards global solidarity against capitalism-imperialism. This website hosts our current and past editions as well as contact for how to get involved!

    <section id="about">
        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Written Revolution is a publication empowering voices on campus to share their creative projects in a collective framework. Fundamentally, this publication platforms revolutionary thought on campus - we believe that writing and art are among the most powerful tools for conducting a revolution. We are aligned with the liberation of all oppressed peoples, with global indigenous rights movements, with people-oriented philosophies and practices, and with anti-capitalist sentiment. In particular, we want to spotlight projects that engage with culture and community by producing radical shifts away from the hierarchical and individualistic.

We share essays, poems, sketches, cartoons, and many other forms of content in order to further the liberatory frame of mind. Written Revolution is open to those who support our cause, and our content submission is open to all MIT community members. We also summarize revolutionary actions and activities taken on campus to further the call to liberation, be it through student unions, grassroots movements and demonstrations, or large-scale organizing. We are here to encourage such collective action on our campus. We are the revolution, and we are writing our own history.
